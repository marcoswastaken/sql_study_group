- **197. Rising Temperature**
  - Requires a JOIN (often self-join conceptually or using date functions) and comparing values from different rows/dates. Note: Could also use LAG() which is a window function, but good to try with JOINs first

**Additional Resources:**
- [Mode Analytics SQL Tutorial: Joins](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-joins/)

## Week 5: More JOINs, Subqueries & Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

**Core Concepts:**

- SELF JOIN
- Subqueries (scalar, in WHERE, SELECT, FROM)
- Introduction to CTEs (WITH clause)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Utilize different JOIN types
- Implement SELF JOINs
- Write subqueries
- Start using CTEs for readability

**SQLZoo Exercises:**
- [8. More JOIN operations](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/More_JOIN_operations)
  - Complete this section
- [4. SELECT within SELECT Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_within_SELECT_Tutorial)

**LeetCode Practice (Easy to Medium):**
- **181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers**
  - Classic SELF JOIN or subquery
- **182. Duplicate Emails**
  - Can use GROUP BY and HAVING, or a subquery with IN
- **627. Swap Salary**
  - This is an UPDATE statement, good for a brief look at DML, but primarily for CASE statement logic. If focusing purely on SELECT practice for this week, maybe 176. Second Highest Salary which uses subqueries/CTEs/offset
- **176. Second Highest Salary**
  - Good for subqueries, OFFSET, or even window functions later

**Additional Resources:**
- [Mode Analytics SQL Tutorial: Subqueries & CTEs](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-subqueries-common-table-expressions/)
