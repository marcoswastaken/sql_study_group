# SQL Study Group Curriculum

A systematic curriculum for learning SQL through real-world datasets and hands-on practice.

## System Requirements

Before running the setup script, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8+** - The setup script requires Python with `venv` module support
- **Git** - For cloning the repository
- **Internet connection** - To download datasets from HuggingFace

### Python Installation Check
```bash
python --version    # Should show Python 3.8 or higher
python -m venv --help    # Should show venv module help (not error)
```

**Note:** The setup script automatically handles:
- âœ… Virtual environment creation
- âœ… Dependency installation
- âœ… Database setup
- âœ… App startup

You don't need to install any packages manually - the script handles everything!

## Quick Start

### One-Command Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd sql_study_group

# Setup and start Week 4 (default)
python setup.py

# Or setup and start any specific week
python setup.py 5
```

### Manual Setup (if needed)
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the app for specific week
python app.py 4              # Week 4
python app.py 5              # Week 5
SQL_WEEK=5 python app.py     # Week 5 via environment variable
```

### What You Get
- **Complete Automation**: One command handles everything from setup to app startup
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Practice SQL queries in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`
- **Real Datasets**: 785K+ job postings and other real-world data
- **Progressive Exercises**: From basic SELECT to complex JOINs and window functions
- **Instant Feedback**: Execute queries and see results immediately
- **Isolated Environment**: Uses its own virtual environment, won't affect your system

## What You'll Learn

- **SQL Fundamentals** - SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
- **JOIN Operations** - INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, complex multi-table joins
- **Data Analysis** - Aggregations, window functions, CTEs
- **Real-world Skills** - Working with messy data, performance optimization

## Curriculum Overview

| Week | Topic | Key Skills |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1-2 | Basic Queries | SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY |
| 3 | Aggregation | GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG |
| 4 | JOIN Operations | INNER/LEFT JOIN, multi-table |
| 5-6 | Advanced Queries | Subqueries, CTEs, window functions |
| 7-8 | Real-world Analysis | Performance, complex business logic |

## How It Works

The setup script automatically:
1. **Detects the dataset** from your chosen week's exercise file
2. **Downloads data** from HuggingFace (data_jobs, movies, etc.)
3. **Creates database tables** optimized for learning
4. **Starts the web app** with exercises ready to practice

The app adapts to different weeks and datasets automatically - no manual configuration needed!
