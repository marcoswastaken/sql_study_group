## ðŸŽ¯ Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Platform Competition Analysis

**Problem Statement:**
Find out which job platforms are most active in different countries. The `locations` table contains country information, and `job_postings` contains which platform each job came from. Your result should show the country name (`job_country`), platform name (`job_via` AS `platform_name`), and how many jobs that platform posted in that country (`platform_jobs_in_country`). Only include platform-country combinations with at least 20 jobs. Order by country first, then by job count (highest first), and limit to 30 rows.

---

### Exercise 2: Platform Business Model Analysis

**Problem Statement:**
Compare job platforms to understand their business models. The `job_platforms` table shows each platform's total capacity, while `job_postings` shows actual usage. Your result should show the platform name (`platform_name`), total capacity (`jobs_posted` AS `platform_capacity`), number of different companies using the platform (`unique_companies`), actual jobs posted (`actual_jobs_posted`), and average jobs per company (`avg_jobs_per_company`). Only include platforms with at least 1000 actual jobs posted. Order by actual jobs posted (highest first) and limit to 15 rows.

---

### Exercise 3: Data Scientist Job Market Analysis

**Problem Statement:**
Analyze the job market for Data Scientists across different countries. Use the `job_postings` and `locations` tables to find jobs where the `job_title` contains 'Data Scientist'. Your result should show the country (`job_country`), total Data Scientist positions (`data_scientist_positions`), how many have salary data (`positions_with_salary`), and the percentage with salary data (`salary_data_percentage`). Only include countries with at least 100 Data Scientist positions. Order by total positions (highest first) and limit to 15 rows.

---

### Exercise 4: Employment Type Specialization by Platform

**Problem Statement:**
Examine what types of employment (Full-time, Contractor, etc.) different platforms specialize in. Join the `job_platforms` and `job_postings` tables, but only include jobs where `job_schedule_type` is not null. Your result should show the platform name (`platform_name`), total jobs (`total_jobs`), full-time jobs (`fulltime_jobs`), contractor jobs (`contract_jobs`), other employment types (`other_types`), and percentage of contractor jobs (`contract_percentage`). Order by total jobs first (highest first), then by contract percentage (highest first), and limit to 20 rows.

---

### Exercise 5: Global Company Expansion Analysis

**Problem Statement:**
Find companies that operate in many different places around the world. Use the `companies`, `job_postings`, and `locations` tables. Your result should show the company name (`company_name`), number of different locations (`unique_locations`), number of different countries (`unique_countries`), and total jobs posted (`total_jobs`). Only include companies with at least 10 different locations AND at least 100 total jobs. Order by unique locations first (highest first), then by unique countries (highest first), and limit to 20 rows.

---

### Exercise 6: Platform Market Leadership Analysis (Advanced)

**Problem Statement:**
Find which platform is the #1 leader in each country, then count how many countries each platform leads. First, create a ranking of platforms within each country based on job count. Then, select only the #1 platform per country and count how many countries each platform leads. Your result should show platform name (`platform_name`), number of countries led (`countries_led`), and market share percentage (`market_share_percentage`). Only include platforms with at least 10 jobs per country. Order by countries led (highest first) and limit to 15 rows.
